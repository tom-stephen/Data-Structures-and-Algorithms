# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Commonly used data structures and algorithms. This was a final project for ENSF 338. These data structures are listed below in the "structure of the project". 


## Structure of project:
There are two pain parts of this project. The Data Structures part and the Graph algorithm part. both parts have their own folders in this repo. The last part of this project is testing. The job of the testing file is to comprehensively test the data structures by creating objects of them and testing all possable functionalities.

### Data Structures
* Linear:
  - SinglyLinkedList (SLL)
  - DoublyLinkedList (DLL)
  - CircularLinkedList (CSLL)
  - CircularDoublyLinkedList (CDLL)
  - Stack
  - Queue 
* Trees:
  - BinarySearchTree (BST)
  - AVL
* Heaps
  - Vector-based max heap (VBH_Max)
  - Vector-based min heap (VBM_Min)
* Nodes
  - Doubly linked node
  - Singly linked node
  - Tree node
  
### Graph Algorithm
* Breath First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Dijkstra
 
### Testing
To test the functions a python testing file was made. In this file it tests all the functions and implementations of the datastructures. this insures proper implementation of the datastructures. 

### Instructions
This code has been packages and posted on PyPi for distrbution. to use the code you your project install the package using `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ TomAndKevinDataStructures==0.2`
